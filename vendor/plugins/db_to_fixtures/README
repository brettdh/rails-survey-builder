db:fixtures:dump
================

a rake task that will extract the current db database contents into fixtures

the fixtures are by default keyed by classname_id, but this can be overriden
by defining 'self.fixture_name_column' on the model

the method can either return a string, which will be a column name to use as
the key, or it can return a proc which takes the instance as a parameter,
allowing complex keys
